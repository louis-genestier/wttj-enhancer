This extension is made using the [Chrome extension boilderplate react vite](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite). It's made to enhance the experience when using [WelcomeToTheJungle](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr) website.

For now the extension only has one feature: it adds a button under a job offer and when clicked it will hide all the offers made by the same company.
